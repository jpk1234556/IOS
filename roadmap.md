- [ ] AHCI/SATA driver for storage
- [ ] Block device abstraction
- [ ] File operations (open, read, write, close)
- [ ] Directory management

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] USB support (basic)
- [ ] Audio driver (optional)
- [ ] Power management (ACPI basics)

**Deliverables:**

- Hardware abstraction layer
- Network connectivity
- Graphics output
- USB device support

### Phase 8: Advanced Features (EXPERT)

**Complexity: EXPERT**

- [ ] SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing) support
- [ ] Advanced scheduling (CFS, real-time)
- [ ] Security features (ASLR, stack canaries)
- [ ] UEFI boot support
- [ ] 64-bit userland applications
- [ ] Package management system

## Security Considerations

### Privilege Separation

- Ring 0 (kernel) vs Ring 3 (user) enforcement
- Memory protection between processes
- Syscall parameter validation
- Buffer overflow protection

### UEFI vs BIOS

- BIOS: Legacy boot, 16-bit real mode start
- UEFI: Modern boot, 64-bit start, secure boot support
- Current implementation: GRUB handles boot complexities

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Kernel component isolation testing
- Memory management verification
- Interrupt handling validation

### Integration Testing

- Full boot sequence testing
- Multi-process execution
- File system operations
- Device driver functionality

### Hardware Testing

- QEMU virtual machine testing
- Real hardware compatibility
- Performance benchmarking
- Stress testing

## Build & Development Environment

### Required Tools

- x86_64-elf-gcc cross-compiler
- GRUB tools (grub-mkrescue)
- QEMU (qemu-system-x86_64)
- GDB for debugging
- Make for build automation

### Development Workflow

1. Code changes in source files
2. Build with `make`
3. Test with `make run` (QEMU)
4. Debug with `make gdb`
5. CI testing with automated assertions
